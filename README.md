# ProjectBase

ProjectBase (PB) is a Utility and Data Access library. PB designed with a database independent interface oriented approach to ensure extentibility and reliablity. PB's codes can be changed or manipulated easily.

PB has 3 type of data access: 

* Automatic Connection Management: Using single connection object and while executing a command, connection is opened and closed automatically.
* Manuel Connection Management: Using single connection object and connection is opened and closed by developer manually.
* Transaction Mode: PB supports PL/SQL type code writing of transactional processes. PB creates transactions and manages them automatically.

PB currently supports Oracle (Managed-Unmanaged Provider), SQL Server databases and OleDb. PB supports MySql provider with v2.0.0 and PostgreSQL with v3.0.0.

Also PB supports low level object mapping features.
